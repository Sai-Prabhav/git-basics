In this lecture we will explore:

- What is git?
- Why git?
- What is GitHub?
- Git VS GitHub
- Setting up Git/ GitHub.
- Learning basic commands 

## What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

- Git is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.
- Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel.
- Torvalds started developing Git in April 2005.
- Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which is British English slang for an unpleasant or silly person): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."

## Why Git?

- Track history
- Collaboration 

## What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. 
- It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.
- Its parent company is Microsoft.



## Git VS GitHub

### Git
- A tool (software) installed on your computer.
- A distributed version control system → tracks changes, manages history, branches, merging.
- Works locally (you don’t even need the internet).

### GitHub
- A service/platform on the internet.
- Hosts Git repositories in the cloud → makes collaboration easy.
- Adds features on top of Git like pull requests, issues, project boards, CI/CD.

**You can use Git without GitHub but you can not use Github without Git.**

## Setting up Git

:::

Setup git by configuring your name and email address in git.
```
$ git config --global user.name "V Sai Prabhav"
$ git config --global user.email "prabhav@example.com"
```

Please use your name and email address in the example above. Also, make sure the email address is same as what you have used when creating an account on github.

### Setup ssk-key
```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C my-name@my-laptop-name
```

That will output the following:
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/anand/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```
Just press Enter.

### Adding ssk-key to GitHub

[GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)

### Create A GitHub repository

### Clone your repository

- Copy your ssh URL from your repo's homepage. Code -> Local SSH -> Copy.

- Open your terminal move to a working directory.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Sai-Prabhav/bmath_notes.git
cd bmath_notes
```

## Learning basic commands

- Your best friend `git status`.

- `git add <file>` to stage/track changes.
  - `git add .` to stage all files.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit all your files.
- `git pull` to get changes from upstream(GitHub) to your local.
- `git push` to update your code to upstream(GitHub).
