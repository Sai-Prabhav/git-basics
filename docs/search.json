It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.\nGit is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.\nGit was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel.\nTorvalds started developing Git in April 2005.\nTorvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which is British English slang for an unpleasant or silly person): “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First ‘Linux’, now ‘git’.”"
